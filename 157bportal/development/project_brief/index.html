    <h1>Project Brief</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>I would like to create an app that caters to sexual assault cases - it would have a tab for urgent phone calls, helpful recordings, pinning locations to a map, and sharing stories.</p>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <p>My goals for this project are to create an app that caters to sexual assault survivors in every way possible - whether that be to help prevent future cases or simply a safe space to share stories. I would also like to learn how to use libraries with my code more comfortably.</p>

        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
        <p>When I think of this app, I envision a minimalistic app with a primary color of purple. I would like to make this app minimalistic because users may be in urgens situations when entering the app so it is best to keep the design simple. As I would like the app to feel modern but simple, I would most likely use a sans serif font. I would have 4 tabs on the bottom of the screen so that users can easily switch tabs without the tabs taking too much screen space. </p>

        <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
        <p>The first interactive feature of this app would be when users would like to share their story. There would be an icon that indicates writing, which users can click on and type out their story in a text box. The second interactive feature would be when users would like to place a pin on a map to warn others about an uncomfortable situation at a particular location. Users would be able to either search for an address or use their fingers to find the location on a map and input details about the incident into a form. </p>

        <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
        <p>My main experience goal for this app comes down to the word confidence. I want the user to feel confident that they are in a safe space to tell their story. I want the user to be confident that they will be safer if they look at the locations pinned on the app. I want the user to feel confident that everything they need, whether that be the sexual assault hotline or a recording to scare off a stranger, will be on this app. I want the user to feel confident that by sharing their story or pinning a location, they will help other people. </p>
