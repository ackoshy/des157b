    <h1>User Test</h1>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Share Your Story Should be on separate page</p>
            <p>Based on user input, Divya and I realized that we should not put the edit form for people to post on a separate page. We plan to change this page so that the edit form is on the same page as the postings.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Map Input Issues</p>
                <p>We realized that when the user pins their location, the pins do not show up on the map until after we refresh the page. We will work on debugging this issue.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Subheaders are Unnecessary</p>
                <p>We got feedback from multiple people that the subheadings that we had on our header sections under the title of each page are unnecessary. We plan to remove the subheadings for every page besides the home page.</p>
            </li>
