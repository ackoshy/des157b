        <p>I have never made a stroyboard before so the first thing I learned from this assignment was how to make a storyboard. When I was creating my storoboards, I was worried that I didn't have much of my designs finalized and just had simple sketches. I learned that storyboards have less to do with the design of your product but more with the situation and the motivations behind the user's actions in regards to your product. </p>
