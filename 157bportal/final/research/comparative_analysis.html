        <p>Circle of Six was an app that was created to help people feel safe when they go out - in regards to sexual violence. This app allows users to create a circle of friends that will track one another's location as well as send alerts. The pros of the app are that people can use this app to think ahead as a preventative measure but the con is that the app has not been updated for the last 2 years.  Additionally, I think another con is that this app basically has the functionality as "Find My Friends", which may be a more effective way to track location. </p>

        <p>The app bSafe is an app where users can select guardians to watch them while they livestream througha video whenever they would like. For example, if a user is walking through a dark alley, the user can choose to livestream as they walk, which will automatically record a video. Additionally, they can turn on an alarm to startle predators or make emergency phone calls. The pros are that this seems to be a very effective way to startle predators, get help, and record all activity. However, this app is not available globally.  </p>
