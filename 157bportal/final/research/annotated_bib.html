        <p>This article talks about the different sexual assault apps that have been developed in the past and the disadvantages of them. The article mentions that some apps, meant to track consent, can actually be used against a victim who changed their mind about consent. Additionally, the article talks about how many of these apps will take "cookies" from our phones and use them as traackers. Fianlly, the article also warns us that an idea of a consent app is highly unlikely to protect victims because of the misunderstood power dynamics in relationships. Consent apps can very easily be turned into a predator's "proof" that is used agains their victim. </p>

        <p>The Office for Victims of Crime has developed a mobile app for victims of race, abuse, and incest. The app provides resources for victims to join support groups, a direct connection to the National Sexual Assault Hotline, self-care practices, etc. There is also a "peer to peer helproom" where victims can connect with other survivors to help them through the process. There is also a section where users can post their own stories and read about other people's stories. This gives them an alternative to direct-messaging or calling while still feeling supported. This got me thinking about my idea and how I can implement similar resources and self-care tools in my product.</p>

        <p>This article talks about the pros and cons of three apps that hope to help prevent sexual assault. The first app is called "Circle of 6." This app is similar to Apple's "Find my Friends" app. It essentially tracks your friends locations so that you know where they are when during a night out. This is great because people can take these measures to feel safer but the app has not had any recent updates and is quite outdated. The second app is called "Toranj" and it is similar to "Circle of 6" but also provides lega/educational resources. However, it is not widely available internationally. The third app is called "bSafe" and it sounds an alarm, makes emergency phone calls, and records a video. This is great because it is meant to frighten attackers while also alerting others through emergency calls. However, it is not free and requires a subscription. </p>
