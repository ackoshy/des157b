        <h2>In what ways has your design for your final project evolved from your Interactive Design Comp?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Before, the way we designed our pages didn’t follow the best design practices. We had one section span the entire width of the page but then the following sections only span 75% of the page. We changed this so that all sections spanned the same width to make them follow the same design.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>In what ways is the functionality or interaction design for your planned final project improved from your Version 1? </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In addition to adding a map with hotspots of where sexual assault cases happened, we also added a button that can allow users to toggle to list view.
            </li>
           
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>How far along are you with the development of your project, and how much more do you need to do to complete it?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We have coded all of the front-end user interfaces of the design so now we need to focus on adding the Back4App database to collect user entries and we also need to incorporate JS libraries such as LeafletJS. Lastly, we need to make minor improvements to our UI. </li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2>Is there anything in your project that you are concerned about being able to produce?
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We are concerned with the functionality where users can report the sexual assault attack and then have that showing up on the map of the exact location coordinates. It seems a bit complicated and we aren’t exactly sure on how to go about implementing it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> 
        <h2>If you are working with a partner, identify what you have both done so far and what you will each be doing to complete your project.
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Divya → So far has coded the front-end UI pages of the hotline and alarms page.</li>
            <li>
                Annabel → So far has coded the front-end UI pages for the interactive map page and the share your story page.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the upcoming week, we will both work on the backend using Back4App to save user data. We will also incorporate LeafletJS and one more JavaScript library as well as fixing up the UI.
            </li>
        </ul>
